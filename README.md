After several years working as a teacher in Poland and then several more selling maps in the largest and oldest map shop in the world in London I went back to school - Makers Academy - and graduated as a born again coder.

I quickly realised that the more I learn, the more I want to learn - so I’m looking for a junior developer job that will allow me to  continue growing my skills, making code beautiful, and TDD.

#### What I’m passionate about

Passion for expanding my knowledge is what defines me. I learn fast and I love it - whether it’s new languages (be that JavaScript or Spanish), picking up the tricks of the cartography and book trade or binging on everything popular science  - it’s all about broadening my horizons.

#### What I’m like to work with

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed.

I’m a team player. I work hard and thrive on new challenges. I appreciate being mentored by those who know more than I do. No job is too small - every detail gets my full attention. I’m patient, persevering and personable.
